# 🧟 CryptoZombies Solidity Course Implementation


A complete implementation of the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io) Solidity course, which teaches how to build games on Ethereum.

## 📚 Course Progress

| Lesson | Status | Topics Covered | Screenshot |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| 1: Making the Zombie Factory | ✅ | Solidity basics, contracts, structs, arrays, functions | ![Lesson 1]. |
| 2: Zombies Attack Their Victims | ✅ | Mappings, msg.sender, inheritance, imports, interfaces | ![Lesson 2]. |
| 3: Advanced Solidity Concepts | ✅ | Function modifiers, ownable contracts, gas optimization | ![Lesson 3]. |
| 4: Zombie Battle System | ✅ | Random number generation, battle functionality | ![Lesson 4]. |
| 5: ERC721 & Crypto-Collectibles | ✅ | ERC721 tokens, token transfers, SafeMath | ![Lesson 5]. |
| 6: App Front-ends & Web3.js | ✅ | Web3.js, frontend integration with Ethereum | ![Lesson 6]. |

## 🚀 Features

- Complete implementation of the CryptoZombies curriculum
- Well-organized code structure by lesson
- Added web interface for interacting with the smart contracts
- Documentation and comments throughout the codebase
- Visual demonstrations with screenshots

## 🧪 Smart Contracts Overview

The project includes several interconnected smart contracts that build on each other:

1. **ZombieFactory**: The base contract for creating zombies
2. **ZombieFeeding**: Allows zombies to feed on other creatures
3. **ZombieHelper**: Adds zombie leveling and special abilities
4. **ZombieAttack**: Implements a battle system between zombies
5. **ZombieOwnership**: Implements the ERC721 standard for NFT ownership

## 💻 Web Application

A simple web interface is included that allows users to:

- Connect their Ethereum wallet
- Create new zombies
- View their zombie collection
- Battle other zombies
- Level up their zombies
